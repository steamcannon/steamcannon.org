      Developer List - steamcannon-dev@steamcannon.org
      ================================================
  
      The developer list is where the developers discuss internal designs, 
      choices and complexity. If you are interested in the inner workings 
      and how they are built, the developer list is an excellent resource.
      
      Since the developers also participate on the user list, there is no 
      need to initiate bug reports on the developer list. The developers will 
      escalate true defects to the developer list to determine the proper course of action.
