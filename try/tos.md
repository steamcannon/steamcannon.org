# As-is

The *try.steamcannon.org* service (henceforth and forevermore referred to
as the "Service") is offered on an as-is basis.  It's beta software.  It's
beta open-source software.  Hosted by the developers, not a crack team of
dedicated admins who rub down the machines thrice daily with sake.

*There will be downtime*.  Chances are, there will be a lot of downtime.
We may also randomly and arbitrary lose data.  Or perhaps the data won't
match reality.  This sort of thing happens.

We'll do our best to keep things sane and happy, we really will.  We want
you to have a great experience.  But we simply cannot (and will not) be
responsible if you decide to leverage this demonstration service for
anything that actually costs you dollars or lives. That's just not a good
idea.

Given that, The Service is offered and guaranteed exactly as it performs
during usage.  No guarantee about expected performance, function or
operation is implied or directly stated.  It does what it does.

# Responsibility for charges

When you use the Service, the Service is spending *your* money, 
from your IaaS cloud account, to stand up a PaaS on *your* behalf.

Considering that it's your account, and instances for you, then
yes, you need to pay that bill.  If you forget and leave a PaaS
running over the weekend, and rack up a few bucks, we *will not*
be responsible for that.  

We highly advise double-checking your resource usage from
Amazon's own console to verify that you're using what you
think you're using.

# Pass-through Terms of Service

When you use the Service, the Service will perform operations on your
behalf, against an underlying IaaS provider.  At this time, the
underlying IaaS provider is Amazon Web Services.

By using the SteamCannon service, you also agree to abide by the
full terms-of-service of Amazon Web Services.  Amazon's terms-of-service
may be located [on their website](http://aws.amazon.com/terms/).

Sticking us between you and Amazon absolves you of *none* of your
responsibilities or agreements with Amazon.

# Appropriate Usage

The Service is a shared web portal, which is intended to be used
by humans.  Do not target the Service with malicious or misbehaved
automated scripts, daemons or bots.

If you need to scrape the occasional page, be reasonable.  It's even
better if you ask for an API.  That'd be nice.
