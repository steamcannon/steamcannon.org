      The development of SteamCannon is primarily sponsored by Red Hat, Inc.

      The code is developed as open-source, with a publicly-accessible
      [source-code repository](/development/source_repository/).

      The code is continuously built using [continuous integration](/development/continuous_integration).

      The team is lead by Ben Browning and is supported by the other members of [ProjectOdd](http://projectodd.org/).
