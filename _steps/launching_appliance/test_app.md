title: Play With SteamCannon
---

Go to the Instances screen, find your running SteamCannon appliance,
and copy it's Public DNS. Open http://<instance_public_dns>:8080 in
your browser to play with SteamCannon.

It can take a few minutes for the instance to boot and SteamCannon to
start so if the page doesn't open right away wait a few minutes and
try again.
