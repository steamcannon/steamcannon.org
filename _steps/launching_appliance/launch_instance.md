* 1 instance, any availability zone, at least m1.small
* use default kernal and ram disk, no user data needed
* give your instance a name if you like
* choose or create a key pair if you want to be able to SSH into the instance, not necessary for playing around
* choose an existing or create a new security group, we'll open port later
* review details and launch instance
