title: Enter Your Amazon Credentials
---

On initial login, you'll be prompted to enter your Amazon Access key
and Secret Access Key. After entering them the SSH Key and Realm
dropdowns will populate. All instances started by SteamCannon will be
launched in the selected realm.

The SSH Key is optional and only needed if you intend to SSH into the
instances started by SteamCannon. This shouldn't be needed under
normal circumstances but can be useful for troubleshooting if
something goes wrong. Amazon's documentation has more details on
[generating SSH key pairs][ssh_key_pair].
