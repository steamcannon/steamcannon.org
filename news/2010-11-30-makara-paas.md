Today, Red Hat announced the acquisition of [Makara].  I met the Makara guys
at JBossWorld earlier this year and saw the cool stuff they are working on.
Founded by a bunch of ex-Wiley guys, Makara has some amazing monitoring and metrics
capabilities custom-made for cloud deployments.

The SteamCannon team looks forward to working with the Makara guys to 
unify the two strategies into a super-awesome project.  We're committed to
helping move their code into open-source in a cohesive manner and hook
it all up to the IaaS facilities Red Hat is also working on.

For more information, see posts by [Issac] and [Tobias].

We look forward to the road ahead with Makara.
