The SteamCannon [released the first public beta](/news/2010/10/29/steamcannon-1-0-0-beta1/) 
of the SteamCannon PaaS broker software today.

Being a broker, and cloud-centric, the team decided to run an
instance of SteamCannon, in the cloud, to broker resources
for other people.

To make it as easy as possible to use SteamCannon, we've setup a
hosted instance at <https://try.steamcannon.org>. 

Registration is currently limited, but anyone may [request an
invitation][invitation] and we will send out invites as capacity
permits.

You'll need to bring your own Amazon AWS credentials to the
table, because we're not paying for your consumption.

We intend to keep the hosted service fresh through regular
updates, incorporating your feedback and requests.  Using the
hosted service (for evaluation purposes only, see the
[Terms of Service]) is the best way to keep abreast of the team's
progress.
