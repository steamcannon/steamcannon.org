We released a blob of software today, and that's awesome.  We also
released that blob in a somewhat easier to consume format, as
a downloadable virtual machine.  Then we registered a virtual
machine image at Amazon EC2 so there's not even any downloading
involved.

But what's easier than booting a machine?  How about we produce this 
software, as a service, and you just browse to it.  Fancy that.

To make it as easy as possible to use SteamCannon, we've setup a
hosted instance at <https://try.steamcannon.org>. 

Registration is currently limited, but anyone may [request an
invitation][invitation] and we will send out invites as capacity
permits.

You'll need to bring your own Amazon AWS credentials to the
table, because we're not paying for your consumption.

We intend to keep the hosted service fresh through regular
updates, incorporating your feedback and requests.
