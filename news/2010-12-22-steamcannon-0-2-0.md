The SteamCannon team is pleased to announce the second official release of
the SteamCannon software. The version for this release is #{page.version}. 

Notable changes in this release:

* SteamCannon now exposes a Deltacloud compatible API. The SteamCannon
  API endpoint at /api.xml provides links to a Deltacloud endpoint for each
  user-specific environment.  To use it, point a [Deltacloud client][dc_client]
  at an environment endpoint, e.g. /environments/:id/deltacloud.
  Read more about it in our [documentation][docs].
* SteamCannon now supports Organizations that can share EC2 credentials, 
  with Users grouped under each organization. {docs?}
* We now provide 64-bit platforms in addition to 32-bit, allowing you to 
  run larger instance types.
* Each environment now has an event log, to provide more insight into the 
  instance startup and deployment process.
* Each environment also now displays approximate usage, to give you a feel
  for your running EC2 cost.
* We have [deprecated our prior release scheme][version_scheme], and now 
  refer to the 1.0.0.beta1 release as 0.1.0.

For a full list of all the changes in this release,
check out our [JIRA][jira] or [Git][git] logs.

We're shipping three platforms in this release, in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions:

* **Developer Instance** containing JBoss AS and PostgreSQL on a single image
* **JBoss 2-Tier** containing a mod_cluster image and a JBoss AS image
* **JBoss 3-Tier** containing a mod_cluster image, a JBoss AS image, and a PostgreSQL image

The platforms are based on [JBoss AS 6 CR1][as6cr1], [TorqueBox 1.0.0.RC1-SNAPSHOT][torquebox],
[mod_cluster 1.1.0][mod_cluster], and [PostgreSQL 8.4.5][postgresql].


Grab the Amazon AMI, VMware appliance, or .zip bundle from our
[download](/download) page. We'll be updating our [hosted version](/try/)
in the next couple of days to the #{page.version} release.

If you run into any issues, bring them up on our [mailing
lists](/community/mailing_lists/) or [IRC channel](/community/) and
we'll help you work through them.
