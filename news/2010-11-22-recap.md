## SteamCannon Recap for Nov 13 - 22

1) A thread was started on our developer's mailing list
(steamcannon-dev@steamcannon.org) to discuss the upcoming RESTful API
for SteamCannon. If you'd like to provide input on the API design,
now's your chance. Thread archive:  
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.steamcannon.devel/126>

2) We've successfuly built 64bit AMIs for all our platforms. This
means in the next release you'll be able to run the larger Amazon
instance types for applications that need more memory or CPU.

3) At the request of some of our users, we've added the admin console
and jmx console back to all of our JBoss AS images instead of just the
developer standalone image. They are password-protected with a
different randomly generated password for each environment. The
changes will be included in our next release.
